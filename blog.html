                        <h2>Introduction to Web Development.... Dated: 04/12/2023</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my blog! Here we explore the fascinating world of web development, from HTML and
                              CSS to JavaScript and beyond. Stay tuned for tutorials, tips, and best practices. Web
                              development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of
                              websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually
                              reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps.

                              Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those
                              sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great
                              user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of
                              programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the
                              platforms they are working on.</p>
